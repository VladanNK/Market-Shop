A simple program that represents a simple store where you can buy various products. Before starting the purchase, the user will be asked to enter information such as name, age and city in the appropriate format. Adding products to the cart is done by entering their number under which they are located. There is also a functionality where one of the entered products can be removed by entering "-1" and then entering the correct name of the product. Through each product addition, there will always be an accompanying message whether the purchase continues. The excepted answers should be "d" or "n". When the purchase is finished at the end of the program all the products will be printed, they can also be found in the file racun.txt.
